# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was created to support my learning journey through code. As I learn about web development, it can become overwhelming quite quickly, so this project is to help categorise and log information in a structured manner. This will aid me, and act as a guide I can refer to throughout my learning journey, and in doing so I get to put my new skills into practise whilst debuggin along the way.

## Installation

## Usage

This project can be used for storing all the information learnt throughout the course, and acts as a revision guide for the languages we have covered. When using DevTools we can actively update the JS file in the console. All the various topics are categorised, making it easy to recap on specific topics due to the list format under each topic heading.


## Credits

N/A.


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
